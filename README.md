# Race-Day
This JavaScript code assigns race numbers and start times based on a runner's age and registration status. Early adults get a race number above 1000 and start at 9:30 AM, while late-registering adults start at 11:00 AM. Youth runners start at 12:30 PM. If the runner is exactly 18, they are prompted to check with the registration desk.
